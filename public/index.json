Overview # Silence is a cooperative stealth game created over the span of 4 months by a team of 6 students from the FTIMS university.\nIt was made for the ZTGK 2023 contest and got to TOP 3 in the Game Development category.\nIt was also awarded by the 11 bit studios company.\nThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem to support it. The gameplay is focued on cooperation between the two players. As agent, you have to sneak around the map, avoiding the guards and activating the switches. As hacker, you have to help the agent by distracting the guards and hacking the security cameras. Because of the assymetry between the abilities of the two players, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial that they communicate and cooperate with each other.\nYou can download the game on itch.io or check the source code on GitHub.\nDevelopment # Art # Assets # All the assets - models, textures and animations were created single-handedly by Agata Granosik. They were made using Blender and Substance Painter, and then later imported into the game using our own custom tools. The game\u0026rsquo;s artstyle was designed to be realistic, yet a bit stylized. Textures were created using the PBR workflow.\nMusic and Sounds # Renderer # PBR Renderer with Deferred Shading # The renderer is based on the Physically Based Rendering model. It uses a deferred shading technique to render the scene in multiple passes. Because of that, our engine is capable of rendering hundreds of lights without any performance issues.\nPictured above is the tutorial scene with all the lights visualized.\nVolumetric Lights # The renderer supports volumetric lights, which are used to create a more climatic atmosphere. They are computed based on the light\u0026rsquo;s shadow map and raymarching.\nThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem to support it. Bloom # The renderer also supports a bloom effect, which is used to create a more realistic lighting.\nThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem to support it.
